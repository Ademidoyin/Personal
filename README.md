# Personal
I am a self-taught developer in the learning process.
This project contains codes written by me to master my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The homepage interface was modelled after a webpage i saw on YouTube.
The service section was modelled after Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's service section.
The pictures are also from her site.
It has a simple description of what html and css is and does.
