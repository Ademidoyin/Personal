                    <h3>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h3>
                    <p>HTML is not a programming language. I will liken html to the bricks or blocks you use to give your house a form or specific shape. I wish html was enough. But except for extreme cases where life throws its baggages
                    at us, nobody would love to stay in a house that is not plastered. I hope you understand HTML is not enough.  </p>

            <h4>Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS)</h4>
            <p>I love CSS. When you are done giving your house a structure, you plaster, add paint. For Nigerians, most of us are familiar with Finecoat paint. CSS is that
            bucket paint, brush and other things you use to make your house beautiful.</p>

                a training in Lagos, Nigeria. For Newcomers in Nigeria, do not do it. Udemy
                courses are better than the ones i have encountered and i have met other pople who have corroborated this.

            <h3>The Problem with the Training Centres</h3>
            <p>Basically, the only and major problem with them is that they build castles in the air.
            Telembout you becoming a full-stack developer in 3months. To them, it does not matter who is left behind.
            Even Javsacript should take you 3months to fully get your hands on.

                <h3>A Bright Side</h3>
                <p>I try not to be totally pessimistic. You get to meet a host of learners like yourself. You do not have to do all the researches all by yourself.
                With them, your journey does not feel entirely hopeless. You know the power of moving in a pack. Someone else sees something you are missing.

                <p>At this point, i feel like attending another tutorial will just leave me traumatized. Lol. The tutorial hell. 
                It feels like trauma. I am looking out for internship programmes where i can have real-life experiences.
